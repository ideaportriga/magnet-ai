While the competence in their role and the respect and professionalism shown towards colleagues are remarkable strengths, there are areas such as reliability in meeting commitments and asking for support earlier which need improvement. The employee is regarded as growing in professional skills and adaptability but can further elevate productivity toward the end of the week.\n\n## Continue Doing\nRespondents appreciate the employee’s:\n- High skill level and knowledge in their role.\n- Demonstrated professional growth and adaptability to new technologies.\n- Consistent treatment of colleagues with respect and professionalism.\n- Clear and efficient communication skills.\n- Initiative in trying to resolve issues independently.\n\n## Stop Doing\nRespondents suggest the employee should:\n- Avoid attempting to solve all tasks independently for too long without seeking clarification or assistance when needed.\n- Rely less on trying to figure out tasks alone, potentially leading to delays in meeting deadlines.\n\n## Start Doing\nRespondents encourage the employee to:\n- Increase proactive engagement and productivity, particularly towards the end of the week.\n- More frequently acknowledge and appreciate colleagues' contributions.\n- Consistently identify opportunities for improvement and propose valuable solutions.\n- Seek assistance and ask questions sooner to ensure commitments and deadlines are reliably met.\n\n## Recommendations\nTo score higher performance marks, the employee should:\n- Enhance end-of-week productivity by setting more tangible goals or engaging with colleagues to brainstorm efficient ways to wrap up weekly tasks.\n- Cultivate a habit of regular appreciation to bolster team morale.\n- Adopt a more proactive approach to identifying process improvements and potential solutions early.\n- Develop a more collaborative mindset by leveraging team resources and support sooner, especially when facing challenges.\n\nBy integrating these practices, the employee can strengthen their impact in their role and further align with clients' and colleagues' expectations.\n```",
