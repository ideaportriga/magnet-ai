# Steps to Configure an AI App

1. Create a new AI App and add at least one AI Tab. Each AI Tab can be connected to one tool like RAG Tool, Agent, etc. Select the AI Tab type and tool.

2. Use Tab type “Tab Group” if you want to add second level to AI App navigation. For example, a tab group “Help Center” could contain two tabs: “Customer portal help” and “General questions”.

3. Check AI App settings like design style and whether it is necessary to show logo and Close button.
   

4. Save the AI App and grab the URL to embed it. The other way is to call the AI App using its system name. Learn more about it in the API reference.
