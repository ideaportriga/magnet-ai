# Agent Conversations

This report provides information about Agent conversations for the maximum of 7 last days.

It comes in a list view and an analytical dashboard where you get an overall summary of all Agents as well as summaries for specific Agents.

Some metrics are available immediately once a conversation has started, while post-processing metrics come in after the conversation is closed. If a conversation was not explicitly closed by the user, it is automatically closed after a time period configured for the Agent.

### How to make the most of Agent Conversations Usage feature

- **Enable user feedback** to track user likes, dislikes, and comments. Enable this feature in the UI Settings tab of Agent configuration.
  
- **Enable post-processing** to collect data about language, user sentiment, category and resolution status. This data is generated by the LLM, so enabling this feature (from the **Post-processing** tab on Agent details) adds one extra call to LLM.
  
- Use the **“View trace”** link in record details to view detailed information about Agent execution steps - using this data, you can track down quality and performance issues.
