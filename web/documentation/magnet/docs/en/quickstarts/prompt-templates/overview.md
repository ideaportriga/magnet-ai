# Prompt Templates

Prompt Templates are  reusable sets of instructions and LLM configurations that determine how the LLM responds to user input.

Prompt Templates play a crucial role in tools like RAG Tools where they shape the tone and format of generated response, or in Agents, where they analyze user queries and select the appropriate tools for processing. They are the cornerstone of virtually every other AI feature you build with Magnet AI.

But Prompt Templates are powerful on their own too - they can be called directly from a CRM to summarize a case, translate an email, draft a message, and more.
