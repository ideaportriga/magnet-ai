# Using Retrieval Tools

### Using Retrieval Tools in Agents

_Coming soon_

### Using standalone Retrieval Tools

Retrieval Tools can be used on their own in the same way as RAG Tools.

A typical use case for Retrieval Tools is semantic search over technical documents or instructions. This feature can be delivered to end users by including the Retrieval Tool into an [AI App](../ai-apps/overview.md), which takes just a few mouse clicks.

So, once your Retrieval Tool is ready, just add it to an AI App, grab the generated URL and embed the app into your CRM. For a more tailored usage, call the AI App or the Retrieval Tool by its system name.
