# Agents

Agents in Magnet AI use the tool (function) calling ability of the LLMs to orchestrate their work and dynamically generate workflows based on given context. Frequent use cases for agentic flows include customer email processing and customer case resolution.

While Gen AI Agents are quite complex systems, Magnet AI enables admins to configure and deploy agentic flows through a low-code interface.
