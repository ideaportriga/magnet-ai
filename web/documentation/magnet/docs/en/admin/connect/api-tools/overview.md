# API Tools

API Tools enable other tools configured in Magnet AI to communicate with external systems like CRMs. API Tools is what really empowers Agents to solve end-user problems by reading or updating data from other systems.

Similarly to Knowledge Source and Model Provider configuration, you will first need to configure your API Providers and, once connection between your API Provider and Magnet AI is established, you can add API Tools. To add an API Tool, you will need an API specification in YAML or JSON format.

Then, API Tools can be given to Agents as Actions (tools).

Let's have a closer look at API Tool configuration in the next chapter.
