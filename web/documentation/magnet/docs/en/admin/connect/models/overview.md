# Models

Magnet AI provides the UI to easily connect chat completion, vector embedding, and re-ranking models. 

You Magnet AI instance comes with a selection of model providers configured on the backend depending on your setup. As an admin, all you need to know to add models are their provider names, like `gpt-4o-mini` or `text-embedding-3-large` . Once you have your models added to Magnet AI, they become available for selection across the application. 

Make sure you also configure capabilities and pricing for your LLMs, so that LLM call costs are calculated accurately.

> If you are using **Magnet AI demo playground**, you do not need to do anything, as the models are already configured in the application.
